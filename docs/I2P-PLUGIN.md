### I2P Plugin Support

Since version `1.5.0`, this package has had basic plugin support in Java I2P.
This means it can be integrated with your I2P installation or portable package, with
the benefit of reduced size requirements, automatic updates, and integration with the I2P UI.
Installation in this way is **platform-independent**, the same package is used for Linux, Windows, and OSX.
In this type of installation, the profile manager install is entirely managed by I2P.
Uninstalling I2P will also uninstall the profile manager.

#### Downloading the Plugin

Right now, the best way to download the plugin is from the Github releases page.
