To-Do List:
===========

1. Don't Repeat Yourself. Move all functions that all profiles have in common
 to a common class and then have them all inherit that class.
2. Offer `-usability` flag which sets an alternative extension loadout.
3. Decide on an GUI component for launching the browser/variants with the choices:
 - Launch $firefox_variant in I2P Mode
 - Launch $chromium_variant in I2P Mode
 - Launch system default browser in I2P Mode(Potentially Unsafe!)
